# HackTheBox-WriteUps

This Repository will contain reports of all machines I have cleared from the website HackTheBox. As each machine is retired, I will upload the corresponding document for each machine.

Each report is structured into two major sections, getting a shell and gaining User access, and the second part contains privilege escalation and root access. All hashes for the machines have been removed from any images, and instead only the first 16bits of the hash remain, so as not to ruin the box for anyone else. A final section details any extra tools that were downloaded to complete the box, as well as links to the corresponding authors GitHub page, and a direct link to where they can download the tool. A final section details what was learnt from each machine, as well as any further reading, if necessary.
