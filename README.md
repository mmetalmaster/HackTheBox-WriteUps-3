# HackTheBox-WriteUps

This Repository will contain reports of all machines I have cleared from the website HackTheBox. As each machine is retired, I will upload the corresponding document for each machine.

Each report is structured into its major sections: Reconnaissance, obtaining a shell, privilege escalation to root, and a final section on new techniques learnt. All hashes for the machines have been removed from any images, and instead only the first 16bits of the hash remain, so as not to ruin the box for anyone else. A third smaller section details any extra tools that were downloaded to complete the box, as well as links to the corresponding authors GitHub page, and a direct link to where they can download the tool.
